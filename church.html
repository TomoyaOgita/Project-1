    <p>The Bible consists of two parts – the Old Testament (the time before Jesus) and the New Testament (during and after Jesus’ life).  The list of books that make up the Bible is called the canon.  However, the canon is different for different Christian churches.  All Christian Bibles have the same 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New Testament, but Catholics include seven more books in their Old Testament (commonly referred to as the Deuterocanonicals) plus some additional material in the books of Daniel and Esther.  Orthodox Christians also recognise some other books in their canons.  The 39 books of the Old Testament also form the Hebrew Bible of the Jewish people.</p>

    <p> Batak Christian Church will send the pastor's sermon every Sunday, so you live in God's word easily after you listen to the pastor's sermon.</p>

    <p>The goal of the sermon is to speak faithfully the Word of God to those who have come to hear God’s revelation proclaimed. It presumes that the preacher has invested the time both to hear the Word of God and to understand the application of it to the speaker’s and the hearer’s lives.</p>
